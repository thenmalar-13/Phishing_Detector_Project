# 🛡️ Phishing Detector & Awareness Logger

A beginner-friendly Python project that simulates phishing email detection and teaches users how to recognize red-flag content. Built as part of my internship to spread cybersecurity awareness.

## 📌 Project Features
- Loads simulated emails from a CSV file (`emails.csv`)
- Detects phishing signs using regular expressions
- Asks the user to mark emails as safe/unsafe (Y/N)
- Provides instant feedback with explanations
- Logs all user responses with timestamps in `log.csv`

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.11+
- CSV Handling
- Regex for pattern detection
- VS Code for development

## 💡 How It Works
1. Run the script `main.py`
2. Each email appears in the terminal
3. User types `Y` or `N` to guess if it's safe
4. Program responds if the guess was correct and explains why
5. Results are saved in `log.csv` for review

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Real-world phishing red flag indicators
- How to work with CSV files and logs
- Writing simple regex for security pattern detection
- Improving user interaction in the terminal

## 📂 Files Included
- `main.py` - Main logic and detection code
- `emails.csv` - Sample email dataset
- `log.csv` - Logs user session responses
